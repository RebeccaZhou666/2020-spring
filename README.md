# Dynamic Web Development
**NYU, Interactive Telecommunications Program, Spring 2020**

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

*Dynamic Web Development* introduces the fundamentals of building "full stack" web applications. This course will focus on modern, client- and server- side web technologies and provide practical methods for approaching web development for creative and functional applications. The core technologies used in this course are HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js with the Express framework, and MongoDB database. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy web applications and gain the necessary skills to extend and explore web development independently. 

The course will be a mixture of lecture and in-class collaborative coding, with weekly programming and reading homework.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

* â†³ [Read the Code Of Conduct here](/CODEOFCONDUCT.md)

## OBJECTIVES

By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

* Full-Stack Javascript - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
* UI/UX Design - Creating wireframes and style guides, and translating them to code.
* Designing Data-Driven Applications - How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
* Using APIs - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
* Structuring Data - How to intelligently structure data.
* Storing Data - How to build systems to store your own data.
* Building APIs - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.
* Deploying full stack applications - Deploying applications using Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) with Git/GitHub, Glitch, and Heroku.

NOTE: These goals and objectives were adapted from Sam Slover's [API of you class](https://github.com/sslover/api-of-you) and the previous [ITP's 2018 DWD Course](https://itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/dwd_spring2018/).

## OUTCOMES

In order to achieve these objectives, students will spend the semester building, refactoring, getting feedback and iterating on, one project throughout the course. The interactive web application will require students to exercise each of the key skills taught throughout this course as well as equip students with the skills to continue developing new dynamic web applications after the course.

### GRADING

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that coding and making things is tough, therefore your effort, curiosity, and engagement is of utmost importance. You will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

#### GRADE CALCULATION:

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 20% Attendance/Participation
* 50% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 20% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

Here's an outline of how your assignments and final will generally be evaluated. The explaners of each category are rough guidelines for how I assign numbers (or quantify ðŸ˜‰) to the work you are producing in this class. Inspired by [cmda-tt course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-17-18/tree/master/assessment-3).

| Category | 1 - 2 pts | 3 - 4 pts | 5 - 6 pts | 7 - 8 pts | 9 - 10 pts |
| :------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**  | The work is handed in late, broken, incomplete, undocumented, or shows lack of care or thought | The work is only partially documented and seems only partially complete | The work is documented and represents the student's concept and shows good effort | The work is well documented, thoughtful, and professional | The work shows mastery and is well polished |
| **Understanding** | There is either no substance or the student cannot explain or justify decision making | The work shows partial grasp of the concepts, but shows major gaps that could be addressed with more thought | The work is sensible and grounded and can be explained in a coherent manner | The work represents the concept well, references past and current work. The student can speak to more than 1 perspective. | The work shows strong graps of concepts and the state-of-the-art. The work is well received in both concept and implementation |
| **Application** | The work reflects very little conceptual references to the course materials; a general lack of awareness to methodology and implementation | The work applies methodology(ies) that have some potential, but not quite relevant or effective | The work uses methods that are appropriate and thoughtful. The application of methods are standard and show good potential | The work uses methods that are appropriate, thoughtful, and well implemented. There are innovative ideas that are shown in the application. | There work shows careful methodological considerations and is beautifully crafted, designed, and presented. |

#### ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICY: 

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 20% of your grade.


#### LATE ASSIGNMENTS:

Late assignments **will not be accepted** except under special circumstances or with a doctors note. 

If you have not "finished" your assignment you still must submit what you have done to the appropriate assignment submission google form. You can improve on your submitted assignent after submission, BUT your work will not be reviewed if it is passed the deadline. 


## NYU STATEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES


### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism is presenting someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writerâ€™s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.
